# UserService requirements

Create a microservice with the following:
* [X] A User rest Resource that allows clients to create, read, update, delete a user or a list of users.
* [X] You can use a database of your choice but itâ€™s also fine to just use a map or dictionary in memory to keep track of users by their ids.
* [ ] Use structured logging.
* [ ] Add Metrics (e.g. statsd, dropwizard, prometheus, to time routes)
* [ ] Write unit tests for the service.
* [ ] Generate a code coverage report.
* [X] The user JSON can just be id, first name, last name, zip code, and email address.
